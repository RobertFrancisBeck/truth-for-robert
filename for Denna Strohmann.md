## I Never Did Anything to You

Deanna,  
I have never done anything to you. Right?  
However, you have assassinated my character over decades.  
Right? Why?  
Right? Why?

I never did anything to you. Of course.  
I tried to be your *friend*. Right?  
I hung out with you? Right?  
Uh-oh.

## What Were You Always Trying to Do?

What were you always trying to do with my relationship with her?  
You tried to step in the way at every opportunity.  
I got that.  
I have a list.

Okay.  
Now what did I ever do to you?  
**Nothing.**

## What About Juan?

The night shift compounder.  
He said:

> "I NEVER HAD *** with Deanna!"

He repeated this over and over like a haunted man.

Oh shoot.  
Yeah.
