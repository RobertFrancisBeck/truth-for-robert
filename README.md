# 🕊️ Truth for Robert F. Beck  
**A Living Testimonial Archive**

Welcome. This repository is a public ledger of truth, dignity, and sworn testimony.  
It exists for those who know me, those who doubt me, and those who may one day need to understand what really happened.

Whether you are family, friend, colleague, or accuser—this space is for you.  
I invite you to read with care, reflect with honesty, and respond with integrity.

## 🧭 Why This Exists

I created this archive to:

- Preserve the truth in my own words.
- Offer clarity to those who were misled.
- Document ethical grievances and care incidents.
- Empower others to reclaim agency through testimony.

Each file is a sworn statement.  
Each word is offered under oath, up to and including the U.S. Supreme Court
